Planned Projects

 
Alerts: Scan all alerts for "Approve new results (BSF/TY/extended eligibility) if MFIP not reopened." Check CaseOverview for each case, and put the MFIP prog status on Alerts (next to case number?). (probably need to store data in localStorage since the table refreshes after each change, then re-add data after each refresh)
 
CaseNotices: Cancel All? Cancel All but billing forms? Cancel All but first SA letters? Cancel All to specific target?
 
CaseUnearnedIncome: If #incomeType.val().change to Unemployment Insurance, add 2 inputs: lastPaymentProcessDate and remainingBalance; add button: calc and enter. OnClick, divide remainingBalance by #incomeProjectionAmount, multiply by 7 (plus 7, round 0), subtract dateDiff of start date from lastPaymentProcessDate, add that many days to lastPaymentProcessDate, put addedToDate in #paymentEndDate, make sure #tempIncome set to Yes
 
CaseCopayDistribution: Button: Copy #overrideReason, provider name/copay$ from #providerInformationTable, store in sessionStorage. Button: Retrieve storage, click Edit, enter #overrideReason, change copay$ for matching providers
 
CaseChildProvider: "Warning: Have Provider Training requirements been met?" Function to check trainings completed and date done.
 
CasePaymentHistory: if end date !== row up end date && end date +1 !== row up start date: add span that says "Gap"? after BWP
 
Notice pages, Alerts with Worker Created selected: Add single arrow buttons around date fields, modify dates by 1 month per click
 
Change all date fields to be 12ch wide, plus the parents thereof if in a col-lg/col-md div. For first date field, reduce padding-right to 5px?
 
Alerts, InactiveCaseload: Stop button for when automated process is happening.
 
CaseList: Enter clicks #submit
 
ClientSearch: Enter clicks search #submitbtn
 
CaseOverview: Program Information table.click( if 
 
CaseRedetermination: If page shows "Warning: An Eligibility Approval" -> auto-save, add 'Must approve results!' text to page if '#redeterminationStatus' value === "Updates Required"
 
Client search: If only 1 result, select result
 
Provider search: If only 1 result showing, select result
 
Alt+S to also click save. N for new, E for edit. If #quit.length > 0, #next & #previous hotkeys are...? alt + left right? 
If viewMode add unmodified keys for /n/ew, /e/dit, /w/rap-up, /d/elete, elig next (right), elig previous (left), /c/ancel notice, /r/emove cancel...
 
Bug: CaseCSE - Dupe Wrap Up always shows disabled
 
Table behavior (test): table {​​​​ scroll-snap-type: y mandatory; scroll-padding: #? 0; }​​​​​​​​​​​ table td {​​​​​​​​​​​ scroll-snap-align: start; }​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
 
CaseEligibilityResultSelection (And SA pages?)
If Strong "Background transaction" countdown timer and reload? SA Page might also have 'No results for case'
 
Active case list
Add queries for additional subjects: Phone number, active providers, CCAP program type vs MFIP open, ...?
Check suspended cases for a childsProvider entry. Flag if none for delaying redetermination date to allow case to auto-close beforehand.
 
If active element = table, down/up goes to next/previous row
 
Summary:
Step 1: links in new tabs except redetermination and application.
Step 2: iframe the heck outta that page.
Step 3: Button to check for problem/inhibiting items (unverified items, forms No, etc)
 
Alerts - Delete All:
Count each type of alert, output into end message.
 
Income/expense pages: Store Payment Change date, auto-enter even if value exists.
