Strong: "Actual date is missing" eleFocus #actualDate

CaseMemberI: Make link to member history always available

Bug: CaseCSE - Dupe Wrap Up always shows disabled

Case activities: !viewMode If activity begin date !== '', eleFocus end date

Input needs padding-left treatment to line up Pass/Fail/N/A like CaseEligiblityResultFamily page (..Person page has the issue)

else CaseEligibilityResultSelectionSelf or countdown timer and go to Elig results? Strong "Results successfully submitted."

"Warning: Effective date" & !viewMode: eleFocus Save
Copy Mail Address: Margin-right 0

CaseChildProvider
editMode: If no start date, remove tabindex from end dates. Edit current tabindex rules for reporter type, and remove tabindex logically (if none selected yet, if not LNL, etc)

Summary:
Step 1: links in new tabs except redetermination and application.
Step 2: iframe the heck outta that page.
Step 3: Button to check for problem pages (unverified items, forms No, etc)
